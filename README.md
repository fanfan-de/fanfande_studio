## Overview

Anybox is an open-source desktop workspace for working with AI agents on local projects. It brings project folders, agent conversations, terminals, model and provider settings, skills, MCP servers, permissions, patches, and tool traces into one inspectable Electron app.

The repository is a `pnpm` workspace. The main desktop product lives in `packages/desktop`; the local agent runtime and HTTP service live in `packages/anyboxagent`.

## Highlights

- Open local project folders as agent workspaces.
- Run multi-turn agent sessions with visible reasoning, assistant output, tool calls, permission requests, errors, and patches.
- Use a managed local agent service by default, or connect the desktop app to a custom agent endpoint.
- Work with an integrated terminal powered by `node-pty` and `xterm`.
- Configure model providers, MCP servers, skills, plugins, and project-scoped settings from the app.
- Review workspace changes and use Git-oriented desktop workflows for commits and pushes.
- Pair with the companion mobile app package for remote desktop control workflows under active development.

## Download

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 10.28+
- Bun 1.3+

### Install

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
```

### Run The Desktop App

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The desktop app starts the local Anybox agent service automatically by default.

### Run The Agent Service Manually

Use this when you want to inspect or debug the backend independently:

```bash
cd packages/anyboxagent
bun run dev:server
```

The service listens on `http://127.0.0.1:4096` by default.

To make the desktop app connect to an already running service instead of starting its managed service:

```powershell
$env:ANYBOX_DISABLE_MANAGED_AGENT="1"
$env:ANYBOX_AGENT_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:4096"
pnpm dev
```

## Common Commands

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm dist
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm verify:versions
```

Package-specific checks:

```bash
pnpm --filter anybox-desktop-agent typecheck
pnpm --filter anybox-desktop-agent test
pnpm --filter anyboxagent exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json
pnpm --filter @anybox/shared typecheck
pnpm --filter @anybox/shared test
pnpm --filter @anybox/platform typecheck
pnpm --filter @anybox/platform test
pnpm site:build
```
